#  Xylophone

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sounds and use AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great application developer is being able to solve my own problems and find out how to use existing tools by reading the documentation. 


## What I will create

I will be making my first musical instrument! Musical apps are so popular on the App Store that they even get their own category. Weâ€™re going to make a colourful XyloPhone app. 

## What I will learn

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* How to use tags in Interface Builder.
* Error handling using try and catch.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging for array index out of range errors.
